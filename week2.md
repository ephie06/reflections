This webpage represents protected areas (land and marine) in several different ways. First is a world map where you can toggle on and off different categories of protected areas. The same information is represented again in proportional rectangles. There is a chart showing the growth in protected areas compared to the target. There are two more world maps breaking down percentage of protected area by country: one for land areas, and one for marine areas that you can toggle categories of countries by percentage of marine area protectes.

I don't find these visualizations to be very effective. I didn't see the point of the toggle function at first. But in the first map there is overlap between some of the areas. And when you toggle everything off it's easier to see just one of the areas at a time. I don't find the color choices very appealing either. It is cool to see the protected areas represented on the world map and be able to zoom in. The line chart is pretty clear showing the growth and the targets over time. I think the marine toggle map is odd too. Maybe they should have just put the color inside the country instead of a thick outline around it.
